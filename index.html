                Heyy.. my name is Rohan Kumar and I am a computer
                application student. Here I have shared my view about books that
                I read recently. The views are purely
                personal. Although I do not want to give
                good time to read books but I am not able to.
                You can take good taste of a lite galnce of
                the story inside the book.

                This is a story of a minor girl. She got married in very early 
                age, now there are allots of social and ethical issues that She
                managed and also this story reflects the Indian social beliefs
                during thoes time. Nirmala was not a lucky girl as she thought
